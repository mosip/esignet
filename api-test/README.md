# eSignet API Test Rig

## Overview

The **eSignet API Test Rig** is designed for the execution of module-wise automation API tests for the eSignet service. This test rig utilizes **Java REST Assured** and **TestNG** frameworks to automate testing of the eSignet API functionalities. The key focus is to validate the authentication, signature generation, and related functionalities provided by the eSignet module.

---

## Test Categories

- **Smoke**: Contains only positive test scenarios for quick verification.
- **Regression**: Includes all test scenarios, covering both positive and negative cases.

---

## Coverage

This test rig covers only **external API endpoints** exposed by the eSignet module.

---

## Pre-requisites

Before running the automation tests, ensure the following software is installed on the machine:

- **Java 21** (or a compatible version)
- **Maven 3.9.6** (or higher)
- **Lombok** (Refer to [Lombok Project](https://projectlombok.org/))
- **setting.xml** ([download here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-functional-tests/blob/master/settings.xml))
- **apitest-commons** library should be cloned and the JAR should be built. Refer to ([README](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-functional-tests/blob/release-1.3.0/apitest-commons/README.md))

### For Windows

- **Git Bash 2.18.0** or higher
- Ensure the `settings.xml` file is present in the `.m2` folder.

### For Linux

- The `settings.xml` file should be present in two places:
  - In the regular Maven configuration folder (`/conf`)
  - Under `/usr/local/maven/conf/`

# API Test Rig Configuration

The API Test Rig is configured to work with different core service plugins, such as MOSIP-ID, Mock-Identity-System, and Sunbird Insurance. It allows for dynamic testing and validation of workflows related to identity management and authentication.

## Integration of eSignet API Test Rig with Core Service Plugins

The Test Rig is dynamically configured based on the core service plugin being tested (either MOSIP-ID, Mock-Identity-System, or Sunbird Insurance). The configuration is as follows:

### 1. Configuration for MOSIP-ID Plugin:
- **eSignetbaseurl**: The Test Rig will use the live eSignet instance integrated with the MOSIP-ID service.
- **mosip_components_base_urls**: A string defining the base URLs for various components.
- **esignetActuatorPropertySection**: To fetch the configuration and properties from the actuator for service interactions.

### 2. Configuration for Mock-Identity-System Plugin:
- **eSignetbaseurl**: The Test Rig will use the live eSignet instance integrated with the Mock-Identity-service.
- **mosip_components_base_urls**: A string defining the base URLs for various components.
- **usePreConfiguredOtp**: A flag to use pre-configured OTPs. Set to "true" for OTP-based workflows.
- **esignetActuatorPropertySection**: To fetch the configuration and properties from the actuator for service interactions.
- **esignetSupportedLanguage**: Any 3-letter valid language code to create OIDC client (e.g., "eng", "hin", "tam").

### 3. Configuration for Sunbird Insurance Use Case:
- **eSignetbaseurl**: The Test Rig will use the live eSignet instance integrated with the Sunbird insurance service.
- **sunBirdBaseURL**: The Test Rig will use the live Sunbird registry instance integrated with the Sunbird insurance service.
- **esignetMockBaseURL**: Specifies the baseURL of Sunbird instance (e.g., "esignet-sunbird.").
- **esignetActuatorPropertySection**: To fetch the configuration and properties from the actuator for service interactions.
- **esignetSupportedLanguage**: Any 3-letter valid language code to create OIDC client (e.g., "eng", "hin", "tam").

### eSignet Deployment Configuration (Required for API Test Rig):
These configurations need to be added as part of the eSignet service deployment to support the API Test Rig:

- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_AUTHENTICATE_ATTEMPTS**: 300
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_SEND_OTP_ATTEMPTS**: 300
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_AUTH_CHALLENGE_BIO_MAX_LENGTH**: 200000
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_PREAUTHENTICATION_EXPIRE_IN_SECS**: 600
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_CAPTCHA_REQUIRED**: (empty)

These parameters must be included in the eSignet deployment YAML for the API Test Rig to function correctly, independent of which plugin is being used.
