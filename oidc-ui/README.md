# Esignet UI

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the UI of MOSIP Esignet Services.
Esignet Services are based on [OpenID specs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

Esignet UI contains the following pages:

1. Authorize
2. Login
3. Consent

- `/authorize`:
  This is a redirect URI that needs to be called from the relying party portal. This is the endpoint that handles the oidc authorization. For API details, refer to this [document](https://mosip.stoplight.io/docs/identity-provider/85f761d237115-authorization-endpoint).

- `/login`:
  It is a page that can be loaded with any one of the following components.

  - Sign in with Biometrics
  - Sign in with OTP
  - Sign in with PIN(MOCK)
  - Sign in with Password

  Each component allows the user to authenticate in a different way. Each component is mapped to an auth-factor constant.
  For example

  - BIO: Sign in with Biometrics
  - OTP: Sign in with OTP
  - PIN: Sign in with PIN
  - PWD: Sign in with Password
  - KBA: Sign in with Knowledge Based Authentication

  The initialization of the component on this page is contingent upon the authentication factors received from the oauth-details endpoint. These authentication factors are determined based on the acr_values parameter specified in the authorize request.

  The password-based authentication system incorporates a functionality allowing users to initiate a password recovery process through a designated `Forgot Password` hyperlink.

  **Note:** The labels for the KBA form is fetched from i18 bundle of OIDC-UI.

- `/consent`: is a page that prompts the user to provide consent to share one's details from the Integrated Identity Server to the relying party. It shows authorize scope that needs to be permitted and, essential and voluntary claims that need to be accepted or rejected.

## Build & run (for developers)

The application runs on PORT=3000 by default.

- JSON configuration variables (`theme/config.json`)
  
  - **username_info_icon**: Place the information icon adjacent to the username label within the password login interface.
  - **background_logo**: Place the logo on the left side of the main card on the login and consent pages.

  - **remove_language_indicator_pipe**: Eliminate the indicator pipe adjacent to the language display within the navigation bar.
  - **outline_toggle**: Substitute the outline toggler in lieu of the slider toggler.

- Theme based configuration

    To customize the theme of OIDC-UI, modify the variables within the `variables.css` file located in the `public/theme` folder. Adjust the CSS variables based on the requirements, and these changes will be reflected in OIDC user interface. The variables encompass attributes such as color, image paths, and numerical values in pixels (e.g., for height, width, etc.).

- Environment configuration properties (`public/env-config.js`)
  - **DEFAULT_LANG**: default language for the platform
  - **DEFAULT_WELLKNOWN**: wellknown endpoints for the platform
  - **DEFAULT_THEME**: theme for the platform, if nothing is given it will take a root theme from `public/theme/variable.css`
  - **DEFAULT_FEVICON**: favicon icon for the platform in the browser tab,
  - **DEFAULT_TITLE**: title of the platform in the browser tab,
  - **DEFAULT_ID_PROVIDER_NAME**: name to be shown in the platform for the provider name


- Build and run Docker for a service:

  ```
  $ docker build -t <dockerImageName>:<tag> .
  $ docker run -it -d -p 3000:3000 <dockerImageName>:<tag>
  ```
  To host oidc ui on a context path: 
  1. Remove the location path with `/` in the nignx file and add the location with context path as below.
    ```
    location /oidc-ui {
       alias /usr/share/nginx/oidc-ui;
       try_files $uri $uri/ /oidc-ui/index.html;
    }
    ```
  2. Provide the context path in the evn variable `OIDC_UI_PUBLIC_URL` during docker run.
  ```
  $ docker build -t <dockerImageName>:<tag> .
  $ docker run -it -d -p 3000:3000 -e OIDC_UI_PUBLIC_URL='oidc-ui' <dockerImageName>:<tag>

  # The UI will be hosted on http://<domain>/oidc-ui
  ```
  

- Build and run on the local system:
  - Update ".env.development" file, add REACT_APP_ESIGNET_API_URL=<'Complete URL of Esignet Services'>
  - Start oidc-ui
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```
  - Run the browser with web-security disabled. For Google chrome the command is
    ```
    chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
    ```
  - Open URL http://localhost:3000
