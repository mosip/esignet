        OAuth details request is raised from the UI JS application on page load.

        OAuth details endpoint validates the provided request parameters and resolves the required authentication factors. Combination of resolved authentication factors and the consent details are sent back as response with a unique transactionId.

        The transcationId in the response is used to identify/maintain the enduser pre-auth session. This pre-auth session has timeout (configurable in Idp service).

        Authentication & authroization : None, starts the pre-auth session with unique transactionId.

        All the query params passed to /authorize API MUST be sent to /oauth-details endpoint. All these parameters will be validated in IdP before returning success response.

        1. Validates the clientId.
        2. validates redirectUri is one of the redirectUri during client create/update.
        3. validates display,responseType,prompts values are part of supported values in Idp properties.
        4. scope / acrValues / claims / locales / claim_locales - unknown values are ignored. Only valid values are considered.
        5. scopes like profile, email and phone are allowed only if "openid" is also part of the requested scope.
        6. Claims request parameter is allowed, only if 'openid' is part of the scope request parameter
        7. claims considered only if part of registered claims.
        8. ACR in claims request parameter is given the first priority over acr_values query pararmeter.if none of them are part of the registered acrs, registered ACRs are only considered to derive the authfactors.

        1. Validates transactionId.

        3. Invokes kyc-auth call to integrated authentication server (IDA).
        4. Relays error from integrated authentication server to UI on failure.


        On Authentication Success: Only transaction Id is returned in the below response without any errors.

        On Authentication Failure: Error list will be set with the errors returned from the integrated authentication server.

        Currently mock-authentication-server : supports only <b>pin</b> based authentication.

        Once the client / relying party application receives the authorization code through redirect, this OIDC complaint endpoint will be called from the relying party backend application to get the ID and access token.

        Authentication & authroization : validates the code (authorization code) in the request.

        1. The only supported client authentication methods : <b>private_key_jwt</b>
        2. clientAssertion is a signed JWT with Clients private key, corresponding public key should be shared with IdP during the OIDC client registration process.
        3. clientAssertion JWT payload must be as below: 

        The JWT MUST contain the following REQUIRED Claim Values and MAY contain the additional OPTIONAL Claim Values:

        <b>iss</b>

        REQUIRED. Issuer. This MUST contain the client_id of the OAuth Client.

        <b>sub</b>

        REQUIRED. Subject. This MUST contain the client_id of the OAuth Client.

        <b>aud</b>

        REQUIRED. Audience. The aud (audience) Claim. Value that identifies the Authorization Server as an intended audience. The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended audience for the token. The Audience SHOULD be the URL of the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.

        <b>exp</b>

        REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

        <b>iat</b>

        REQUIRED. Time at which the JWT was issued.

        <b>Note:</b>
        The ClientAssertion JWT can contain other Claims. Any Claims used that are not understood WILL be ignored.
